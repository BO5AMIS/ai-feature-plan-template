## 🎯 Mission Critical Context
**Building a secure, scalable authentication system with JWT tokens, OAuth support, and role-based access control - NOT a simple login form.**
**AI Development Philosophy**: Each task is designed for independent execution by Opus 4.1 with specific implementation details, file paths, and acceptance criteria.

## 🧠 Prompt for LLM to Extend This Plan
> You are an AI coding agent. **Append** additional phases (e.g., Phase 2.5, Phase 3, …) and any required tasks/subtasks **after this line**.
> **Constraints:**
> - **Do not modify** any content above.
> - **Replicate the exact structure** used in Phases 0–2: *Phase Setup → Main Task 1..N (Objective + Subtasks) → Exit Criteria*.
> - Use concrete, actionable subtasks with file paths, commands, and tests.
> - End each task with: "Update progress in task tracker and commit changes."
> - Maintain consistent branch naming and semantic version tags per phase.
> - Add "Overall Progress Tracker" entries as you add phases.
> - Keep estimates realistic and grouped by phase.
