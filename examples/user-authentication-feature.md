# Feature/Product Plan: User Authentication System

## üìã Overview

**Feature/Product Name:** User Authentication System with Social Login

**Status:** Planning

**Priority:** P0 - Critical

**Estimated Timeline:** January 15, 2024 - March 1, 2024

**Owner:** Authentication Team (Backend: Sarah Chen, Frontend: Mike Rodriguez, Security: Alex Kim)

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Our web application currently has no user authentication system, requiring users to re-enter information on every visit and preventing us from offering personalized experiences. Users cannot save preferences, track their activity, or access premium features. Additionally, we have no way to identify returning users for analytics or targeted features.

### Who is affected by this problem?
- **Primary Users:** All website visitors (currently ~10,000 monthly users) who want to save preferences, access premium content, or track their activity
- **Secondary Users:** Customer support team who can't identify users or access their history
- **Business Impact:** Cannot implement premium features, track user retention, or provide personalized experiences, limiting revenue potential by an estimated 40%

### Why is this important now?
- Upcoming premium feature launch requires user accounts (Q1 2024 deadline)
- Customer support team spends 30% more time without user identification
- Competitive analysis shows 90% of similar platforms offer authentication
- Marketing team needs user tracking for personalized campaigns launching in Q2

---

## üöÄ Solution Overview

### High-Level Approach
Implement a modern authentication system supporting email/password and social logins (Google, GitHub) with JWT tokens, password reset functionality, and email verification. Use OAuth 2.0 for social providers and include optional two-factor authentication for enhanced security.

### Key Benefits
- **User Benefits:** Save preferences, access premium features, seamless experience across devices, secure account protection
- **Business Benefits:** Enable premium feature subscriptions, improve user retention tracking, reduce support burden, enable personalized marketing
- **Technical Benefits:** Standardized user identification, foundation for authorization system, improved security posture

### Success Metrics
- **Primary KPIs:**
  - User registration rate: >25% of visitors sign up within 30 days
  - Authentication success rate: >99% login attempts succeed
  - Time to complete registration: <2 minutes average
- **Secondary Metrics:**
  - Social login adoption: >40% choose social over email registration
  - Password reset completion rate: >80%
  - Support tickets related to access: <5% of total tickets
- **Leading Indicators:**
  - Registration funnel conversion at each step >70%
  - User return rate within 7 days: >30%

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
Frontend SPA communicates with REST API backend for authentication. JWT tokens stored securely in httpOnly cookies for web, localStorage for mobile. OAuth handled server-side with secure token exchange. Redis for session storage and rate limiting. Email service for verification and password reset.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18, React Router, Axios, React Hook Form
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Passport.js for OAuth, bcrypt for password hashing
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for user data, Redis for sessions and rate limiting
- **Infrastructure:** AWS EC2 for API, RDS for PostgreSQL, ElastiCache for Redis, SES for email
- **Third-Party Services:** Google OAuth API, GitHub OAuth API, SendGrid for transactional emails

### Data Model
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255), -- NULL for social-only accounts
  email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  two_factor_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  two_factor_secret VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Social accounts table
CREATE TABLE social_accounts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  provider VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'google', 'github'
  provider_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Password reset tokens
CREATE TABLE password_reset_tokens (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with short expiration (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
- **Authorization:** Role-based permissions with middleware validation
- **Data Protection:** GDPR compliance, encrypted PII, secure password storage with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- **Input Validation:** SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, CSRF tokens for forms

### Performance Considerations
- **Expected Load:** 1,000 concurrent users, 10,000 daily logins
- **Optimization Strategies:** Redis caching for sessions, CDN for static assets, database indexing on email/username
- **Monitoring:** Response time tracking, error rate alerts, login success/failure metrics
